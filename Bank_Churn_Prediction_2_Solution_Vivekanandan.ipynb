It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities.\n","\n","### Data Description:\n","The case study is from an open-source dataset from Kaggle.The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as CustomerId, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance etc.\n","Link to the Kaggle project site:https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modelingPoints \n","\n","### Distribution:\n","The points distribution for this case is as follows:\n","- 1. Read the dataset\n","- 2. Drop the columns which are unique for all users like IDs (5 points)\n","- 3. Distinguish the feature and target set (5 points)\n","- 4. Divide the data set into trainingand test sets (5 points)\n","- 5. Normalize the train and test data(10points)\n","- 6. Initialize & build the model. Identify the points of improvement and implement the same the same.(20)\n","- 7. Predict the results using 0.5 as a threshold (10points)8. Print the Accuracy score and confusion matrix (5 points)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"szwhm3mUqvJE","outputId":"b6743831-df21-4ad3-ba33-8a41af061b0e"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting
